Welcome to the PICUP computational physics pedagogy workshop!

An outline of the workshop:

### 1. Introduction to PICUP

<a href="AAPT_Winter_2020_UpperLevel.pptx">Introduction to PICUP slides (Kelly Roos' talk)</a>

Some resources:

<a href="https://www.compadre.org/picup/">PICUP website</a>

### 2. Group-work: orbital dynamics in Trinket/Glowscript

After the introduction, we'd like you to do a short exercise on <a href="orbits.html">orbital dynamics</a>. This will illustrate the use of Glowscript/Trinket,
a browser-based VPython interpreter.

### 3. Group-work: simulating pendula in Google Colab

Now, we'll do an exercise involving a computer simulation of a pendulum in Google Colab. One of the great things about Colab is the ability to mix
text and code, so the whole exercise and its instructions are <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OaMP6_hD4vUSBC5XotKPP-eGQfnePucL?usp=sharing">in that notebook itself</a>. You will need to "Make a Copy" of the notebook for yourself so you can edit your own version.

### 4. Discussion

We'll conclude with a discussion of how computational tools can:

* ... help students learn the same kinds of things we were already teaching them, but more quickly and deeply
* ... allow students to learn new things we weren't able to teach them before

We might also explore:

* ... what you think about the "minimally-working code" approach to computational integration and its strengths and weaknesses
* ... what you think about spreadsheets, Trinket/Glowscript, Google Colab/Jupyter, and other programming environments
* ... any thoughts you have about the use of AI in physics education or programming
