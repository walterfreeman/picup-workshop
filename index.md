Welcome to the PICUP upper-level workshop! 

An outline of the workshop:

### 1. Introduction to PICUP

<a href="AAPT_Winter_2020_UpperLevel.pptx">Introduction to PICUP slides (Kelly Roos' talk)</a>

Some resources:

<a href="http://eepurl.com/cGZQzb">Join PICUP</a> 

<a href="gopicup.slack.com">PICUP Slack channel</a>

<a href="https://www.compadre.org/picup/">PICUP website</a>

### 2. Group-work: simulating pendula

After the introduction, we have in mind that you all will spend a little time on an exercise involving a <a href="pendulum.html">computer simulation of a pendulum</a>, and either study the effects of damping and driving (on the same page) or look at how
computational physics can be used to teach early-career students the basics of <a href="perturb.html">perturbation theory through the nonlinearities in the pendulum</a>.

### 3. <a href="showcase.html">Showcase of upper-division projects</a>

### 4. Authoring exercise sets

Have a nifty exercise that you do with your students that you'd like to post to the <a href="https://www.compadre.org/PICUP/exercises/">PICUP exercise set collection</a>? We'll tell you how to submit it for publication.
